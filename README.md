# Where_And_When_IOSApp
IOS App where you guess the location and year of various photos

You can download the code to test it yourself, but in the near future I plan to upload it onto AppStore

This app is developed solely by me, using Swift and a combination of SwiftUI and UiKit. In this game you have 5 rounds, and in each one you are given a random photograph, and you are to guess its location on the map and the year when it was taken. Your aim is to get the highest score.
This app, as of now, is in the final stages of development, so it might still have some bugs, lack certain features and code not be perfect, but it is playable. I am still working on it, mainly on adding more photos, so the pool is more diverse in terms of location.
